        The Customer class should have an arrayList of Doubles (transactions)
        Customer: Name, and the ArrayList of Doubles
        Branch: Need to be able to add a new customer and initial transaction amount
        Also needs to a add additional transactions for that customer/branch
        Bank:
        Add a new branch
        Add a customer to that branch with initial transaction
        Add a transaction for an existing customer for that branch
        Show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally a list of their transactions
        Demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing in your code
        Hint: Transactions
        Add data validations - check if exists of not exists
        Think about where you are adding the code to perform each action
