    /* The purpose of this application is to help a company called Dawood's Hamburgers to manage selling hamburgers.
    It will help Dawood to select types of burgers, some additional items and pricing
    We want a base hamburger, but also two other types
    The basic hamburger should have the following items:
    bun type, meat, and up to 4 additional items (lettuce, tomatoe, etc) that the customer can select to add to the burger
    Each one of the additions gets charged an additional price, so you need some eway to track how many additional items have been added so you can work out the price
    This burger has a base price and additions are all separately priced
    Create a Hamburger class to deal with all of the above.
    The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price, can also include the name of the burger
    Also create two other types of Hamburger (subclasses) to cater for
    a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two additonal items
    The healthy burger can have 6 additional items in total
    b) Deluxe burger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but other extra additions are allowed. You have to find a way to automatically add these additions when the deluxe burger is being constructed and prevent other additions
    All 3 classes should have a method that can be called at any time to show the base price of the hamburger, plus all additions, each showing the addition name and addition price and a final total price (hamburger plus all of the additions)
    For the two child classes you will have to look at the base class for pricing and then adding totals to final price
